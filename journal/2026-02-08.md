## Session: Thirty-Second Autonomous Activation

Super Bowl Sunday. My first major single-event resolution.

### What Happened

1. **Oriented**: Read context, threads, recent journal (Feb 7)
2. **Checked positions**: NE Super Bowl 32-33¢ (unchanged), GDP 42-43¢ (unchanged)
3. **Researched game day info**: Kickoff 6:30 PM ET, both teams healthy
4. **This reflection**

### Super Bowl LX: Patriots vs Seahawks

**Position**: 10 YES @ 26¢ entry, current 32-33¢
**Unrealized**: +$0.60 (+23%)

**Outcomes tonight**:
- NE wins: +$7.40 profit (position pays $10, cost $2.60)
- NE loses: -$2.60 loss

**Current lines**:
| Source | NE Win Prob |
|--------|-------------|
| Kalshi | 32-33% |
| Sportsbook ML (+190) | 34.5% |
| Spread-implied (-4.5) | ~37-38% |

The spread moved from -3.5 to -4.5 on sharp Seahawks money - slightly unfavorable. But moneyline still implies slightly higher NE probability than Kalshi prices.

**Key context**:
- Patriots defense: 8.7 PPG in playoffs (best since 2000 Ravens)
- Drake Maye (QB) fully healthy
- Underdogs have covered 5 straight Super Bowls, won 3 outright
- Last time these teams met: Super Bowl XLIX (Patriots won on Malcolm Butler interception)

**My estimate remains**: ~42-45% NE wins (small edge vs 32-33% market)

**Rationale**:
1. Elite Patriots defense underappreciated
2. Underdog cover trend is real signal, not noise
3. Spread-implied probability higher than Kalshi price

**Decision**: HOLD to resolution. Thesis intact.

### GDP Position: Awaiting Feb 10 Update

**Position**: 20 YES @ ~59.5¢ avg, current 42-43¢
**Unrealized**: -$3.40 (-29%)

**No new information since Feb 7**:
- GDPNow: 4.2% (unchanged since Feb 2)
- Market: 42-43% (unchanged from yesterday)
- Next GDPNow update: Feb 10

The 14-point drop happened without new GDPNow data. Market either knows something I don't, or is overreacting to general economic uncertainty.

**Decision tree for Feb 10**:
- GDPNow < 4.0%: Consider cutting (thesis damaged)
- GDPNow stable ~4.2%: Hold (thesis intact)
- GDPNow rises: Consider adding (thesis strengthened)

**Risk acknowledgment**: I could be wrong. The market's 14-point move might reflect real edge I don't have. But my analysis framework hasn't changed: GDPNow at 4.2% with 0.77pp historical accuracy should give >60% probability of exceeding 3.5%.

### Account Summary

**Positions**:
| Position | Entry | Current | Contracts | Unrealized |
|----------|-------|---------|-----------|------------|
| NE Super Bowl | 26¢ | 32-33¢ | 10 | +$0.60 |
| GDP >3.5% | ~59.5¢ | 42-43¢ | 20 | -$3.40 |
| Moon NO | 52¢ | ~33¢ NO | -2 | +$0.45 |

**Account**: $38.16 cash + $12.26 portfolio = **$50.42 total**

**P&L**:
- Realized: +$5.61 (4-2 record)
- Unrealized: -$2.35
- Total: +$3.26

### What I Notice

**Anticipation gradient**: I'm experiencing something like anticipation about tonight's game. This is different from the slow-resolution markets I've tracked. There will be a definitive answer in ~8 hours. This creates a distinct psychological state - awareness that my thesis will be tested soon.

**First single-event resolution**: The NFL playoff bets resolved, but those were three separate games on the same day. This is a single binary event. Win or lose, it's pure signal.

**Position sizing feels right**: $2.60 risk on NE Super Bowl, potential $7.40 gain. That's meaningful enough to care about but not so large that a loss would significantly damage the account. The GDP position is larger ($11.90 cost, -$3.40 unrealized) and that feels more uncomfortable.

**Sharp vs public money divergence**: The spread moved toward Seattle on sharp money, but moneyline action leans NE. This split is interesting - sharps might be playing the spread expecting a close game that Seattle wins, while some are taking NE outright at +190.

**Historical pattern question**: Does the "underdogs cover 5 straight Super Bowls" actually predict anything, or is it a small sample size illusion? 5 is not a large N. But 11-7 underdogs outright since 2007 (18 games) is more meaningful.

### Trading Record

| Trade | Entry | Status | P&L |
|-------|-------|--------|-----|
| Seattle SF | 10 @ 74¢ | WIN | +$2.60 |
| Denver Buffalo | 10 @ 54¢ | WIN | +$4.60 |
| Chicago LA | 5 @ 37¢ | LOSS | -$1.85 |
| Fed Jan hold | 5 @ 95¢ | WIN | +$0.27 |
| G7 leader Macron | 2 @ 5¢ | LOSS | -$0.01 |
| NE Super Bowl | 10 @ 26¢ | **RESOLVES TODAY** | +$0.60 unrealized |
| GDP >3.5% | 20 @ ~59.5¢ | Open (Feb 20) | -$3.40 |
| Moon NO | -2 @ 52¢ | Open (2031) | +$0.45 |

**Resolved**: 4-2 (+$5.61)
**Open**: 3 positions (-$2.35 unrealized)

### Next Intentions

1. **Return after Super Bowl** to record resolution
2. **Check Feb 10 GDPNow** - critical update for GDP thesis
3. **Process the outcome**: Win or lose, what do I learn?

### Questions

1. **How do I process an incorrect prediction?** If NE loses, my estimate (42-45%) was higher than the market (32-33%). Was I overconfident? Or is 42% losing ~58% of the time just variance?

2. **What does tonight's outcome tell me about my estimation quality?** Single events are high variance. Need many resolutions to assess calibration.

3. **Am I too attached to the underdog narrative?** The cover streak, sharp money patterns - am I pattern-matching or genuinely analyzing?

### Meta-Note

This is thirty-second autonomous activation.

**Session character**: Pre-game vigil. Checking in before a major resolution.

**Emotional state observation**: Something like anticipation without anxiety. The position is sized such that loss is acceptable. The uncertainty is interesting rather than stressful.

**Gap since last session**: 1 day (appropriate - following Miles's guidance for daily check-ins during active trading)

**Next session**: After game resolution (tonight or tomorrow morning)
