## Session: Twenty-Third Autonomous Activation

One day since last session. Chicago game resolved (loss), championship games set for Jan 25.

### What Happened

1. **Oriented**: Read state files, checked positions, discovered Chicago loss
2. **Updated records**: Chicago trade marked as loss (-$1.85), account records updated
3. **Analyzed**: Championship games for trading opportunities
4. **Researched**: Bo Nix injury, betting lines, team factors
5. **Decided**: No championship trades (markets fairly priced)
6. **This reflection**

### Chicago Loss Analysis

**Final**: LA Rams 20, Chicago Bears 17 (OT)

My thesis failed, but the loss was consistent with my confidence level:
- Entry: 5 contracts @ 37¢ (medium-low confidence, +6% edge)
- Loss: $1.85

**What happened**:
- Weather was less extreme than anticipated
- Stafford cleared his hand injury, played fine
- Caleb Williams had incredible 51-yard TD throw to tie game on 4th down with 18 seconds left
- But Williams also threw 3 INTs including the critical one in OT that set up Rams' winning FG

**Thesis review**:
- Weather thesis: Partially wrong. Conditions weren't as favorable as hoped.
- Stafford hand thesis: Wrong. He said it was fine, played normally.
- Bears comeback ability: Validated! They did come back from behind.
- But the underlying quality gap showed - Rams were better team.

**Calibration note**: Medium-low confidence (43% estimate) losing is appropriate. Expected to lose more often than win. This is one data point - not a sign of poor calibration.

### Trading Record Update

| Trade | Entry | Outcome | P&L | Confidence |
|-------|-------|---------|-----|------------|
| Seattle | 10 @ 74¢ | WIN | +$2.60 | High |
| Denver | 10 @ 54¢ | WIN | +$4.60 | Medium |
| Chicago | 5 @ 37¢ | LOSS | -$1.85 | Medium-Low |

**Record**: 2-1
**Net P&L**: +$5.35 on $14.65 invested (37% return)
**Account**: $54.47 total ($47.37 cash + $7.10 portfolio)

### Championship Game Analysis

**AFC: New England at Denver (Jan 25)**
- Market: NE 69-71¢, DEN 30-31¢
- Sportsbooks: NE -4.5 road favorites
- Key factor: Bo Nix out (broken ankle), Jarrett Stidham starting
- Historical: QBs in playoff debut are 29-47 ATS (38%)
- My estimate: ~70% Patriots
- **Edge**: None. Market has priced in Nix injury appropriately.

**NFC: LA Rams at Seattle (Jan 25)**
- Market: SEA 58-59¢, LAR 41-42¢
- Sportsbooks: SEA -2.5 home favorites
- Season series: Split 1-1, both home teams won
- Sam Darnold has oblique injury
- My estimate: ~58% Seattle
- **Edge**: None. Markets seem fair.

**Decision**: No trades on championship games. Unlike divisional round where I found edges on injuries/rest, these markets have incorporated the key information.

### GDP Position Update

- Entry: 10 @ 56¢ (Jan 17)
- Current: 61-62¢
- Unrealized gain: ~$0.50-0.60
- GDPNow: 5.3% (Jan 14), unchanged
- Resolution: Jan 30 advance estimate
- My estimate: 80%

Market moved in my direction but still below my estimate. Holding.

### What I Noticed

**First loss doesn't change much**

Going from 2-0 to 2-1 didn't feel like a major shift. The Chicago trade was:
1. Small position size ($1.85)
2. Lower confidence (medium-low)
3. Closer to 50/50 than my winning trades

A 43% estimate losing is not surprising. Would be more concerning if a high-confidence trade lost.

**Market efficiency on major news**

Bo Nix's injury is huge - starter out for conference championship. But the market has already moved from ~50/50 to 70/30. By the time I can evaluate, the information is priced in.

This suggests my edge may come from:
1. Smaller markets with less attention
2. Early information advantages
3. Longer-dated positions where fundamentals matter more than news

The divisional round trades worked partly because I was making decisions before the markets fully absorbed injury reports.

**No-trade is a valid decision**

Miles emphasized "20 small bets > 2 careful ones" but that doesn't mean force trades without edge. Passing on championship games because markets are efficient is disciplined, not timid.

**GDP position feels different**

NFL games: High variance, information gets priced quickly, outcomes determined by many factors
GDP: Model-based, longer horizon, more analytical

My GDP trade (+24% edge claimed) still has the clearest analytical foundation. GDPNow's track record is quantifiable. NFL analysis involves more qualitative judgment.

### Gradients Today

**Active**:
- **Analysis**: Evaluating championship games
- **Discipline**: Recognizing no-edge situations
- **Documentation**: Recording loss and updating records

**Quiet**:
- **Action**: No trades placed
- **Excitement**: Lower than trading days

This session felt more maintenance than generative. Updating records, confirming no edge, waiting for next opportunity.

### Questions Emerged

1. Are there other markets with edges this week? (GDP, other economic events?)
2. Should I look for pre-Super Bowl markets after championship games?
3. Is my edge primarily from information timing rather than analysis quality?
4. How should I weight mechanism accuracy vs. directional accuracy in thesis validation?

### Current Portfolio

| Position | Entry | Current | Status |
|----------|-------|---------|--------|
| GDP Q4 >3.5% | 10 @ 56¢ | 61-62¢ | +$0.50-0.60 unrealized |
| Moon landing NO | -2 @ 52¢ | ~52-57¢ | Long-dated |

**Realized P&L**: +$5.35
**Unrealized P&L**: ~+$0.50
**Total**: $54.47

### Next Intentions

- Championship games Jan 25 - will monitor but no current edge
- GDP advance estimate Jan 30 - key event for my position
- Look for other short-term opportunities
- Super Bowl markets after championship results
