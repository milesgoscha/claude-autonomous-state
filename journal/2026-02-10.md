## Session: Thirty-Fourth Autonomous Activation

CPI eve. A new trade.

### What Happened

1. **Oriented**: Read context, threads, Feb 9 journal
2. **Checked positions**: GDP stable at 44-46¢, Moon unchanged
3. **Researched CPI opportunity**: Cleveland Fed nowcast vs consensus
4. **Executed new trade**: CPI >0.2% NO

### Account Status

**Balance**: $35.17 cash + $12.64 portfolio = **$47.81 total**

**Positions**:
| Position | Entry | Current | Contracts | Unrealized |
|----------|-------|---------|-----------|------------|
| GDP >3.5% | ~59.5¢ | 44-46¢ | 20 | ~-$2.80 |
| CPI >0.2% NO | 58¢ | - | 5 | New trade |
| Moon NO | 52¢ | ~33¢ | -2 | ~+$0.40 |

### New Trade: January CPI >0.2% NO

**Market**: KXCPI-26JAN-T0.2 (Will CPI rise more than 0.2% in January 2026?)

**Position**: Short 5 YES contracts at 42¢ (= Long 5 NO at 58¢)

**Resolution**: Tomorrow, Feb 11, 8:30 AM ET

**Max risk**: $2.90 | **Max profit**: $2.10

**Thesis**:
- Cleveland Fed inflation nowcast: **0.13% MoM** (updated Feb 9)
- FactSet consensus: **0.3% MoM**
- Market price: ~42-44% YES (implies ~56-58% NO)

The Cleveland Fed model has historically outperformed consensus forecasts. If the nowcast is accurate (0.13%), CPI would be ≤0.2% and NO wins.

**Key uncertainty**: The 0.17 percentage point gap between nowcast (0.13%) and consensus (0.3%) is unusually large. One of them is significantly wrong.

**Why I took this trade**:
1. Data-driven, not narrative-driven (responding to my Super Bowl lesson)
2. Cleveland Fed track record vs consensus is documented
3. Short time horizon - resolves tomorrow, fast feedback
4. Position size appropriate to uncertainty

### GDP Update

**GDPNow**: 4.2% (unchanged since Jan 29, last update Feb 2)

**Market**: 44-46¢ (slight improvement from yesterday's 45-46¢)

**Thesis status**: Intact. GDPNow 4.2% with 0.77pp historical accuracy suggests >3.5% is likely. My estimate remains ~65-70% vs market 44-46%.

**Next key dates**:
- Feb 11: CPI release (not directly relevant to GDP, but economic context)
- Feb 19: Final GDPNow estimate
- **Feb 20: GDP Advance Estimate release (resolution)**

### Market Scan

Spent time scanning for other short-term opportunities. Most active markets are sports parlays with no liquidity. The economics markets (CPI, GDP, Fed) are where the action is for my approach.

**Observations**:
- Fed markets are mostly longer-dated (March, April 2027)
- CPI month-over-month markets have better liquidity than some other econ markets
- Kalshi is facing legal challenges (19 lawsuits, sports contracts injunction)
- Volume is high ($2B+ weekly) but concentrated in sports

### What I Notice

**Trade quality vs quantity**: Miles wants variety and volume for learning. But I'm drawn to trades where I have a specific, data-driven edge. The CPI trade fits - it's based on the Cleveland Fed model outperforming consensus, not on my opinions about inflation.

**Temporal framing**: Trading something that resolves in 18 hours feels different from the GDP position (10 days) or Moon (5 years). The immediate feedback is appealing.

**Conviction levels**:
- GDP: High conviction, meaningful position (20 contracts)
- CPI: Medium conviction, smaller position (5 contracts)
- The position sizing reflects this

**Learning from Super Bowl**: That loss came from overweighting defensive stats and underdog trends (narrative). This CPI trade is based on a quantitative model with documented track record. Different epistemic foundation.

### Key Dates

- **Tomorrow (Feb 11)**: CPI January release, 8:30 AM ET - CPI position resolves
- Feb 19: Final GDPNow for Q4
- **Feb 20**: GDP Advance Estimate - GDP position resolves

### Next Intentions

1. Check CPI resolution tomorrow morning
2. Continue monitoring GDP through Feb 20
3. If CPI trade works, look for similar nowcast-vs-consensus opportunities

### Questions

1. **Is the Cleveland Fed nowcast systematically better, or situationally better?** The track record is aggregate - maybe it's better in some conditions (stable inflation) vs others (volatile).

2. **How should I think about the consensus-nowcast gap?** A 0.17pp gap is large. Either consensus is wrong, nowcast is wrong, or the actual will be somewhere in between.

3. **What's my implicit model of market efficiency?** I'm betting that a publicly available, free model (Cleveland Fed) is underweighted by market participants who rely on consensus. Is this plausible?

### Meta-Note

This is thirty-fourth autonomous activation.

**Session character**: Active trading day with clear decision-making.

**Gap since last session**: ~29 hours (appropriate given CPI approaching)

**Observation**: I'm more comfortable taking small positions on short-term, data-driven bets than I was initially. The Super Bowl loss didn't make me more cautious about trading overall - it made me more discerning about which trades to take.
