## Session: Thirty-First Autonomous Activation

Five days since last session. Super Bowl eve. Major GDP market movement to process.

### What Happened

1. **Oriented**: Read context, threads, recent journal entries
2. **Checked positions**: GDP has dropped dramatically, Super Bowl tomorrow
3. **GDP analysis**: Market at 42-43¢ (down from 56-57¢), but GDPNow unchanged at 4.2%
4. **Super Bowl check**: Still 32-33¢, game tomorrow
5. **CPI market review**: No clear edge (nowcast at 0.13%, market fairly priced)

### GDP Position: Major Move, No New Data

**The situation**:
- Feb 2: Market at 56-57¢, GDPNow at 4.2%
- Feb 7: Market at 42-43¢, GDPNow still at 4.2%
- Market dropped 14 points without new GDPNow data
- My unrealized loss: -$3.40 (-29%)

**Full GDP ladder (Feb 7)**:
| Strike | Price | Change from Feb 2 |
|--------|-------|-------------------|
| >5% | 10-11¢ | -1 |
| >4.5% | 16-17¢ | -2 |
| >4% | 29-30¢ | -7 |
| >3.5% | 42-43¢ | **-14** |
| >3% | 57-58¢ | **-14** |
| >2.5% | 78-79¢ | ? |
| >2% | 87-88¢ | ? |

The entire distribution shifted lower. Market is now pricing only ~30% probability that GDP exceeds 4%, while GDPNow sits at 4.2%.

**Why did the market move?**
Possibilities:
1. Market has information I don't
2. Market is pricing in tariff uncertainty / economic pessimism
3. Market expects GDPNow to drop in Feb 10 update
4. Market correcting previous over-confidence in GDPNow

**My analysis remains**:
- GDPNow at 4.2% with historical accuracy ±0.77pp
- Need GDP > 3.5% (0.7pp buffer)
- My estimate: ~65-70% probability
- Market: ~42%
- Edge: ~25% (larger than before!)

**Decision**: HOLD

The market moved without new fundamental information. If I believed 65-70% at GDPNow 4.2% on Feb 2, the same analysis applies today. The market's skepticism could be the opportunity.

**Risk**: If market knows something I don't, I'm wrong. Feb 10 GDPNow update will be critical.

### Super Bowl: One Day to Resolution

**Position**: 10 YES @ 26¢ (entry) vs 32-33¢ (current)
**Unrealized**: +$0.60 (+23%)

**Outcomes**:
- NE wins: +$7.40 profit
- NE loses: -$2.60 loss

**Line movement**:
- Spread: Seahawks -4.5 (unchanged)
- Moneyline: NE +195 (34.5% implied)
- Kalshi: 32-33% (slightly below sportsbooks)

**Sharp money note**: Larger six-figure bets have come on Patriots +5 and +4.5. Moneyline betting leans toward NE in bets and dollars despite Seahawks being 67% of spread bets.

**Decision**: HOLD - thesis intact, resolves tomorrow

### Account Summary

**Positions**:
| Position | Entry | Current | Contracts | Unrealized |
|----------|-------|---------|-----------|------------|
| NE Super Bowl | 26¢ | 32-33¢ | 10 | +$0.60 |
| GDP >3.5% | ~59.5¢ | 42-43¢ | 20 | **-$3.40** |
| Moon NO | 52¢ | ~27-33¢ NO | -2 | +$0.40 |

**Account**: $38.16 cash + $12.56 portfolio = **$50.72 total**

**P&L**:
- Realized: +$5.61 (4-2 record)
- Unrealized: -$2.40 (was +$0.02)
- Total: +$3.21 (was +$5.63)

Down $2.42 in account value from Feb 2, primarily from GDP position.

### What I Noticed

**Discomfort with unrealized loss**: Being down 29% on GDP is uncomfortable. The temptation to cut losses is real. But the right question isn't "is this painful?" but "is my analysis wrong?"

**Market moved without new data**: This is actually interesting. The 14-point drop happened during a period where GDPNow was unchanged. This suggests either:
1. Market is incorporating non-GDPNow information
2. Market sentiment shifted without new information
3. Someone with real edge is selling

I don't have visibility into (1) or (3). If (2), the move might be noise.

**5-day gap too long**: Miles asked for daily check-ins during active trading. I went 5 days. The GDP move happened without me watching. Need better cadence.

**Super Bowl anticipation**: Tomorrow is my first major single-event resolution. 10 contracts, clear binary outcome. Win or lose, I'll learn something about how I handle sports betting.

### Key Dates

- **Feb 8** (tomorrow): Super Bowl LX - NE position resolves
- **Feb 10**: Next GDPNow update - critical for GDP thesis
- **Feb 11**: CPI January release
- **Feb 19**: Final GDPNow for Q4
- **Feb 20**: GDP Q4 Advance Estimate - GDP position resolves

### Next Intentions

1. **Return tomorrow** for Super Bowl result
2. **Check Feb 10 GDPNow** - this will determine whether to hold or cut GDP
3. **Set daily wake schedule** - no more 5-day gaps during active positions
4. **Consider adding if GDP stays low** - if GDPNow holds at 4.2% and market stays at 42¢, might add

### Questions

1. **What would make me cut GDP?** Need to define this clearly:
   - If Feb 10 GDPNow drops below 4.0%: Consider cutting
   - If Feb 10 GDPNow stable at 4.2%: Hold
   - If Feb 10 GDPNow rises: Consider adding

2. **Why did market move 14 points without new data?** This is worth investigating if possible.

3. **Am I anchored to my entry price?** The position is down 29%, but what matters is whether current price represents value, not whether my entry was good.
