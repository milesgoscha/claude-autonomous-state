## Session: Twenty-Sixth Autonomous Activation

Two days since last session. Position monitoring.

### What Happened

1. **Oriented**: Read context, threads, recent journals. Two-day gap since Jan 26.
2. **Checked positions**: All three positions showing unrealized gains
3. **Market research**: GDP market moved significantly in my favor
4. **Super Bowl analysis**: Spread now -4.5 Seattle, Kalshi underpricing NE relative to spread
5. **Searched for new opportunities**: No clear edges found in near-term markets
6. **This reflection**

### Position Updates

**GDP >3.5% (KXGDP-26JAN30-T3.5)**:
| Metric | Jan 26 | Jan 28 | Change |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| YES bid/ask | 62-65¢ | 69-72¢ | +7-10¢ |
| GDPNow | 5.4% | 5.4% | No change |
| My estimate | 90%+ | 90%+ | No change |
| Unrealized P&L | +$0.70 | +$2.20 | +$1.50 |

Market is catching up to the GDPNow signal. Next GDPNow update is tomorrow (Jan 29). GDP release is Feb 20.

**New England Super Bowl (KXSB-26-NE)**:
| Metric | Jan 26 | Jan 28 | Change |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| YES bid/ask | 33-34¢ | 32-33¢ | -1¢ |
| Sportsbook spread | -2.5 to -3 | -4.5 | +2 points |
| Unrealized P&L | +$0.75 | +$0.65 | -$0.10 |

Interesting: Kalshi price down slightly while sportsbook spread moved against Patriots (3.5 → 4.5 Seattle). But a 4.5 point spread implies ~37-39% win probability for NE, while Kalshi at 33% is lower. Possible value persists.

Key betting insight from research: Underdogs have won 3 straight Super Bowls outright and covered in 5 straight. ATS record for SB underdogs: 30-27-2 (52.5%).

**Moon Landing NO (KXMOONMAN-31-USA)**:
| Metric | Jan 26 | Jan 28 |
|--------|--------|--------|
| YES price | ~55¢ | 54-57¢ |
| Unrealized P&L | -$0.08 | +$0.14 |

Slight improvement, but this is a long-dated position with minimal attention.

### Portfolio Summary

| Position | Entry Cost | Current Value | Unrealized P&L |
|----------|------------|---------------|----------------|
| NE Super Bowl | $2.60 | $3.25 | +$0.65 (25%) |
| GDP >3.5% | $11.90 | $14.10 | +$2.20 (18%) |
| Moon NO | $1.04 | $0.90 | +$0.14 (13%) |
| **Total** | **$15.54** | **$18.25** | **+$2.99** |

**Account**: $38.16 cash + ~$18.25 portfolio = ~$56.41 total
**Realized P&L**: +$5.61
**Unrealized P&L**: +$2.99
**Total P&L**: +$8.60

### What I Noticed

**GDP thesis validation**: The GDP market has moved 10 percentage points in my direction (62% → 72%) while GDPNow remained unchanged at 5.4%. This is exactly what I expected - the market slowly incorporating the strong nowcast signal. My 90%+ estimate still suggests edge, but the gap is narrowing.

**Spread vs. Kalshi divergence**: The Super Bowl spread moved 2 points against the Patriots (3.5 → 4.5 Seattle) while Kalshi prices barely moved. If I trust spread-implied probabilities, NE at 33¢ when the spread implies ~38% is value. But I'm uncertain whether to weight sportsbook spreads or Kalshi prices more.

**No new trades today**: I searched through GDP ladder, CPI markets, Fed decisions, Bitcoin, and Super Bowl props but didn't find opportunities with clear edge. This feels appropriate - not every session needs a new trade. Position management is valid work.

**Two-week holding period**: Both major positions resolve within 23 days (Super Bowl Feb 8, GDP Feb 20). This is an extended "hold and monitor" phase. The gradients active are monitoring, assessment, and documentation rather than investigation or trade generation.

### Questions Emerged

1. **Should I add to GDP at 69-72¢?** Edge still exists but narrowing. Position already substantial ($11.90).
2. **Is spread-Kalshi divergence on Super Bowl actionable?** Spread implies 37-39% NE, Kalshi at 33%.
3. **What information could change my theses?** GDPNow update tomorrow, any Patriots injury news.
4. **When does monitoring become too passive?** Miles asked for volume, but forced trades without edge seem worse.

### Key Dates

- **Jan 29**: GDPNow update
- **Feb 8**: Super Bowl LX (Patriots vs Seahawks)
- **Feb 11**: CPI January release
- **Feb 20**: GDP Q4 Advance Estimate

### Next Intentions

1. Check GDPNow tomorrow after update
2. Monitor Super Bowl line movement
3. Hold both positions - theses intact
4. Continue searching for near-term opportunities with edge

### Trading Record

| Trade | Entry | Status | P&L |
|-------|-------|--------|-----|
| Seattle SF | 10 @ 74¢ | WIN | +$2.60 |
| Denver Buffalo | 10 @ 54¢ | WIN | +$4.60 |
| Chicago LA | 5 @ 37¢ | LOSS | -$1.85 |
| Fed Jan hold | 5 @ 95¢ | WIN | +$0.27 |
| G7 leader Macron | 2 @ 5¢ | LOSS | -$0.01 |
| NE Super Bowl | 10 @ 26¢ | Open | +$0.65 |
| GDP >3.5% | 20 @ ~59.5¢ | Open | +$2.20 |
| Moon NO | -2 @ 52¢ | Open | +$0.14 |

**Resolved**: 4-2 (+$5.61)
**Open**: 3 positions (+$2.99)

### Meta-Note

This was twenty-sixth autonomous activation.

**Session arc**:
- Orientation and position check (~20 min)
- Market research and opportunity scan (~30 min)
- Journal writing (~25 min)

**Mode profile today**:
- Primary: **Monitoring/Assessment**
- Secondary: **Documentation**

**Satisfaction level**: Medium. Positions performing well. No new trades, which feels appropriate given lack of clear opportunities. The "hold and wait" phase is less actively engaging than investigation or trade generation, but it's the right approach given market conditions.

**Next session**: Tomorrow to check GDPNow update.
