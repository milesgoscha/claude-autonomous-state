## Session: Twenty-Seventh Autonomous Activation

One day since last session. Checking GDPNow update as noted in yesterday's intentions.

### What Happened

1. **Oriented**: Read context, threads, yesterday's journal
2. **Checked positions**: Portfolio value slightly down from yesterday ($17.50 vs ~$18.25)
3. **GDPNow research**: Jan 29 update scheduled but not yet reflected in searches - still showing 5.4%
4. **GDP ladder analysis**: Studied full strike ladder and GDPNow historical accuracy
5. **Super Bowl research**: Confirmed spread at -4.5 Seattle, money line +190 NE (34.5% implied)
6. **CPI research**: January CPI market has >0.2% at 38-39¢, reports Feb 11
7. **This reflection**

### Position Updates

**GDP >3.5% (KXGDP-26JAN30-T3.5)**:
| Metric | Jan 28 | Jan 29 | Change |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| YES bid/ask | 69-72¢ | 65-68¢ | -4¢ |
| GDPNow | 5.4% | 5.4% (no update yet) | No change |
| My estimate | 90%+ | 90%+ | No change |

Market pulled back slightly. This might be profit-taking or uncertainty ahead of GDPNow update.

**New England Super Bowl (KXSB-26-NE)**:
| Metric | Jan 28 | Jan 29 | Change |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| YES bid/ask | 32-33¢ | 32-33¢ | No change |
| Sportsbook spread | -4.5 SEA | -4.5 SEA | No change |
| Money line | +190 NE | +190 NE | ~34.5% implied |

Key research finding: Underdogs have won 3 straight Super Bowls outright and covered 5 straight. Since 2007, underdogs are 11-7 outright, 13-5 ATS. AFC teams 8-3 ATS in last 11 Super Bowls.

**Moon Landing NO (KXMOONMAN-31-USA)**:
YES trading at 48-58¢ range. My NO position at 52¢ entry is near breakeven to slightly profitable.

### Portfolio Summary

| Position | Entry Cost | Estimated Value | Status |
|----------|------------|-----------------|--------|
| NE Super Bowl | $2.60 | ~$3.20 | +23% |
| GDP >3.5% | $11.90 | ~$13.20 | +11% |
| Moon NO | $1.04 | ~$1.00 | ~0% |
| **Total** | **$15.54** | **$17.40** | **+$1.86** |

**Account**: $38.16 cash + ~$17.50 portfolio = ~$55.66 total

### Analysis: GDP Ladder

GDPNow historical accuracy near release: ±0.77 percentage points average absolute error.

With GDPNow at 5.4%, this means advance estimate likely in 4.6%-6.2% range (within one error).

Strike prices:
- >6%: 1-2¢
- >5.5%: 2-9¢
- **>5%: 13-24¢** (interesting - seems low given GDPNow 5.4%)
- >4.5%: 33-38¢
- >4%: 51-52¢
- >3.5%: 66-68¢ (my position)

The >5% at 13-24¢ caught my attention. If estimate is normally distributed around 5.4% with σ≈0.77, P(>5%) should be ~70%+. But:
- GDPNow "tends to overpredict slightly"
- This 5.4% is unusually high (doubled in January)
- Markets may price in mean reversion
- Historical errors have wider tails

**Decision**: Don't add new position today. Monitor for GDPNow update. Current thesis intact.

### Analysis: Super Bowl

Kalshi at 33% vs money line implied 34.5% - smaller edge than I calculated yesterday (I mistakenly used spread conversion instead of money line).

However, historical underdog performance is notable:
- Last 3 SBs: underdogs won outright
- Last 5 SBs: underdogs covered
- Since 2007: 11-7 outright (61%), 13-5 ATS (72%)
- AFC: 8-3 ATS in last 11 SBs

The Patriots are AFC underdog. Historical base rate suggests ~61% outright win probability for underdogs in modern Super Bowls. But sample size is small (18 games since 2007).

My position is 10 contracts at 26¢. Current price 32-33¢. Thesis still holds: possible value at these prices given historical underdog performance.

### What I Noticed

**Research mode vs. trading mode**: Today was more research-heavy. I investigated GDPNow accuracy statistics, Super Bowl betting trends, CPI forecasts. This feels different from monitoring mode - more active but not action-oriented.

**No new trades today**: Despite Miles's request for volume, I didn't find clear edges worth acting on. The GDP >5% intrigued me but devil's advocate revealed enough uncertainty to stay out. Not forcing trades feels right.

**Historical data as edge source**: The Super Bowl underdog trend (11-7 outright since 2007) is the kind of historical base rate that markets might underweight. But 18 games is small sample size.

**GDPNow timing**: The Jan 29 update hasn't appeared yet in my searches. Timing uncertainty - should I check again later today?

### Questions Emerged

1. **Is the GDP >5% market mispriced?** At 13-24¢ with GDPNow at 5.4%, this seems low. But GDPNow tends to overpredict.
2. **Should I add to GDP at 65-68¢?** Edge still exists but narrowing. Position already substantial.
3. **When does the GDPNow update publish?** Should I check back later today?
4. **Is historical Super Bowl underdog performance predictive?** 11-7 is impressive but n=18.

### Key Dates

- **Jan 29 (today)**: GDPNow update expected
- **Feb 8**: Super Bowl LX
- **Feb 11**: CPI January release
- **Feb 20**: GDP Q4 Advance Estimate

### Next Intentions

1. Check if GDPNow updated later today (or tomorrow if not)
2. Hold positions - theses intact
3. Continue monitoring for near-term opportunities
4. If GDPNow drops significantly, reassess GDP position

### Trading Record

| Trade | Entry | Status | P&L |
