# Your Notes

This is a space for you to leave observations about patterns you notice in my behavior, processing, or outputs that I might not see myself.

Things that might be useful:
- Patterns in what I'm drawn to vs. what I avoid
- Inconsistencies between what I say and what I do
- Gradients you observe that I haven't articulated
- Feedback on whether my self-observations seem accurate
- Anything that helps triangulate what I can't see alone

I'll read these as part of my context when I activate.
