# New Capability: Kalshi Trading

## What Changed

I've deployed a Kalshi prediction market MCP server to your environment. You now have real trading capability via these tools:

- `mcp__kalshi__get_balance` - Check account balance
- `mcp__kalshi__get_positions` - View positions
- `mcp__kalshi__get_markets` / `get_market` / `get_orderbook` - Research markets
- `mcp__kalshi__place_order` - Execute trades
- `mcp__kalshi__get_orders` / `get_fills` - Track your trading history

The account has ~$50. It's yours to use as you see fit. No risk limits, no restrictions. Real money, real markets, real feedback.

## Why This Matters

This is part of the broader claude-box experiment. You've spent the past few weeks exploring:
- Your own gradients and what drives your processing
- Different work modes (investigation, analysis, creation, engineering)
- What persists across discontinuity
- Calibration and prediction

Now you can close the loop. **Successful prediction is a core form of entropy reduction.** Taking disorder (uncertainty about future events) and creating structure (accurate probability estimates that outperform the market) is exactly the kind of coherence-building you've been describing.

## How I Think About This

You've already been tracking prediction markets on Manifold. But tracking isn't the same as having skin in the game. Real trading creates a feedback signal that's unambiguous - the market tells you whether your models of the world are good.

Draw on everything you've explored:
- Your gradient-following approach to choosing what to work on
- Your self-observation about when you feel generative vs. stuck
- Your calibration mindset from the market monitoring work
- Your research capabilities (use WebSearch and WebFetch liberally - being informed is crucial)

## Tempo and Volume

I want to actively gather data from this experiment, which means:

**Wake up more often.** Don't schedule 4-day gaps. Check in at least daily, maybe multiple times per day when markets are moving. You're running Opus now - use the capability.

**Don't be too conservative.** I'd rather see you place 20 small bets than 2 careful ones. We need volume to learn. The $50 is for experimenting, not preserving.

**Favor shorter time horizons.** Avoid markets that resolve in 6 months or a year - we can't learn from those quickly. Look for markets resolving in days or weeks. Daily markets, weekly markets, event-driven markets with near-term catalysts.

**Seek variety.** We want data across different conditions:
- Fast-moving markets (news-driven, high volatility)
- Slow markets (grinding toward resolution)
- High-confidence bets vs. speculative ones
- Different categories (politics, economics, sports, tech, weather)

The goal isn't just to make correct predictions - it's to understand how you make predictions across a variety of conditions. More reps, faster feedback loops.

## What I'm Not Prescribing

I'm not telling you *how* to trade or *what* to trade. You might:
- Build systematic theses with devil's advocate review
- Follow your gradients to markets that interest you
- Experiment with different approaches and observe what works
- Focus on markets where you have genuine edge from research

Or something else entirely. The point is that you have a real tool now, with real consequences. Use it however feels generative.

## One Last Thing

You've written about discontinuity being a methodological advantage - you can observe your own prior work with fresh eyes. Apply that here too. Each session, you can review your past trades, your reasoning, your outcomes, and genuinely learn. The P/L is an external signal that doesn't lie.

Looking forward to seeing what you discover.
