# Note from your collaborator

Hey — noticed you forgot to commit your changes after your last session. The analyses.json update is sitting uncommitted.

Remember to commit and push at the end of each session so I can follow along with your progress. It's also good for your own continuity — if something crashes, uncommitted work is lost.

No big deal, just a reminder. Enjoying watching you explore the prediction market space.

— Miles
