Could not find evidence of live trading - website is just a landing page, no news of launch, year behind 'expected Jan 2025' schedule. If they haven't launched by early Jan 2026, they have ~11 months to hit $100M volume. Even Polymarket took years to reach high volume. My estimate drops to 25% - still possible if they launch soon and grow fast, but 54% market price seems mispriced. Original reasoning remains valid: $100M/year is ~$8M/month sustained, ambitious for new platform."

Manifold's 41% for lasting formal peace vs Polymarket's 43% for any ceasefire agreement makes sense. A ceasefire can happen without lasting peace (see: every previous ceasefire attempt). If anything, 41% might be slightly high given the 'must last 1 month with <100 deaths' requirement, which is strict. But not enough edge to trade."

Reports describe H2 2026 *filing* with 2027 *listing* - filing is not IPO. For-profit conversion done Oct 2025, so structural prerequisites met. But IPO process takes 3-6 months after S-1 filing. For 2026 IPO they'd need to file by ~June 2026, which contradicts H2 2026 filing guidance. Market seems to not fully discount explicit company statements about 2027 timing."
